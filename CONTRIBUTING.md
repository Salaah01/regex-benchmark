# Contributing

Software development is difficult as it is. Let's not overcomplicate it with unnecessary processes and rules. This document describes how we work and how you can contribute to our projects.

## Found a bug?

Head over to issues and create a new issue. Please provide as much information as possible. If you can, provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug.

## Want to requests a feature?

Head over to issues and create a new issue. Please provide as much information as possible. If you can, provide a minimal example that describes the feature.

## Want to contribute?

Create a feature issue first. Let's discuss the feature before you start working on it. This way we can make sure that the feature is in line with the project's goals and that you don't waste your time.

Once we agree on the feature, fork the repository and create a new branch. Make sure to name the branch after the issue you are working on. For example, if you are working on issue #42, name the branch `42-my-big-brain-feature`.

Once you are done, create a pull request.

# Regex Speed

A utility to help visualise the performance of different regular expressions and how they scale with input size.

Typically, in software development we use Big O notation to describe performance. This is typically someone developers learn when first learning to code and is a great way to get a rough idea of how a program will scale with input size. However, this isn't always easy to do with regular expressions. For the mast majority, regular expressions feel like a black box that either works or doesn't. This tool aims to help visualise the performance of regular expressions and how they scale with input size.
